      <p>Palm trees have long been an iconic cultural symbol of Los Angeles, despite the fact that only one species of palm tree (Washington filifera) is native to the area. Many of the palm trees in Los Angeles come from Brazil, Mexico, and Spain.</p>
      
      <p>Palm trees donâ€™t have elaborate root systems, and are are easy to transport. They grow in predictable and consistent ways, which makes them ideal for urban planners and city developers. While other types of trees are used in cities to help control erosion and provide clean air and shade, palm trees donâ€™t do any of that; their purpose was to help shape Los Angelesâ€™s image and convince people to move there.</p>
        
      <p>One of the things that makes Los Angeles special is its diversity - similar to how Los Angelesâ€™s palm trees come from other parts of the world, so do its inhabitants. By enabling us to â€˜communicateâ€™ with these palm trees, this cloud-connected device aims to showcase the diverse and expatriate nature of Los Angeles.</p>
